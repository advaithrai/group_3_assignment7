In this game, the player controls a ship and plays against enemy aliens. The player controls the ship by pressing the following keys: 'W' moves the ship up, 'S' moves the ship down, 'A' moves the ship to the left, and 'D' moves the ship to the right. The ship shoots bullets when the mouse is clicked, and if the bullets make contact with an alien the alien will be killed and the player's score will increase by 1 point. Aliens will begin to spawn and move down from the top of the screen once the game window is open. The player starts with three lives and loses one life every time an alien collides with the ship before it is killed. The game is over once all lives are lost. The player wins the game if 10 aliens are hit with bullets (10 points are earned). Pressing the Enter key restarts the game.

The enemy aliens are represented by the Alien class. The Alien class has checkHit, checkDistance, and move functions. The checkDistance function returns the distance between the alien and the bullet. The checkHit function determines if this distance value falls so that the bullet sprite makes contact with the alien sprite, and kills the alien object if it does. The move function makes the alien object move downward following a wave pattern. 

The ship is represented by the Ship class. The Ship class has checkDistance, checkHit, and isAlive functions. The checkDistance and checkHit functions work the same way as they do in the Alien class, except here they check for distance between the alien object and the ship object. checkHit will decrease the number of lives by 1 if the alien sprite comes into contact with the ship sprite. isAlive returns a boolean of True if the number of lives is greater than 0 and False if the number of lives reaches 0. 

The bullets are represented by the Bullet class. The Bullet class has a move function, which makes the bullets move upward once they are generated by the mouse click.

Alex made and implemented the Alien and Bullet classes, and also created the sprites for all of the objects in the game. Advaith made and implemented the Ship class. Jina helped to implement the classes and worked on the displays and game reset after a game over or win condition, and also created the description and readme files.
