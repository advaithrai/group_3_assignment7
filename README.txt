Open the group_3_assignment7.pde file. Each of the classes will be opened in a separate tab within the Processing window. Click 'Run' to open the game window. The player controls the ship with the following keys: 'W' moves the ship up, 'S' moves the ship down, 'A' moves the ship to the left, and 'D' moves the ship to the right. The ship shoots bullets when the mouse is clicked. Aliens will begin to spawn and move downward from the top of the screen once the game window is open. The player starts with three lives and loses one when an alien collides with the ship. The game is over once all lives are lost. The player wins the game if 10 aliens are hit with bullets.
